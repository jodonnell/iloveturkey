We got emailed a nasty letter from Bart Lee.  Well Bart you are a
bitch. Following is the insipid letter Bart Lee wrote us.<br><br>

Turkeys!  How dare you two homosexual creatures create such a
repulsive website.  Not only do you make fun of the animal that we all
eat at one of our greatest American Holidays, but you also attack the
Turkish people by falsely misrepresenting their culture.  I find your
pictures with human penises being entered into Turkeys utterly
disgusting.  In fact I was so appalled by the website that I clued
Humane Society onto your website.  You display porno graphic images on
the Internet and do not warn little children of your contents.  Image
the damage you would inflict upon children if they were doing research
for Thanksgiving Day and came across your twisted website.  You have
completely misused the Internet by not providing meaningful
information and I hope your webpage gets taken down very shortly.  It
will be my personal goal to rid the Internet of your trash.

Thank you Bart, for that inspiring e-mail.  I do hope, and im sure
everyone here at iloveturkeybutihateyou.com would agree with me , that
Nancy will one day walk again.  On to other issues.  Jacob and I want
you to know that fucking a turkey is more than just an "immoral act,"
as it claims in the Bible.  The image of the turkey as a love partner
was destroyed by the Catholic Church as a means to end pagan
religions.  You see, the pagans prayed to a lord mother turkey who had
sexy talons and such a large vagina she could soar through the clouds
and rain down love darts.  Just what they had done to women, tridents,
and wolves, they did to turkeys.  Turkeys are "dirty!"  Were common
signs on lamp posts that lined the Christian avenues.  A common
children's poem was:
<br><br>
Turkey Turkey oh so dirty<br>
Spit on you mom and call her christy<br>
Feathers and mud and worms and guts<br>
One kiss on its beak would really suck<br>
<br>
How dare you blasmphamize Christianity Bart?  How dare you?  How
triple dare you? Physical challenge.
