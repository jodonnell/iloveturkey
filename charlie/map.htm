<p>These bottom squares will be the colors you can pick from.
i was thinking of having two rows, a top row would change the 4 inner
triangles, and the bottom row would change the 2 middle rectangles.
the square in the middle and the two larger rectangles to the sides
would be beveled(pre-cut to look pretty) glass, but could later be
modified to be other things if the customer wanted.
