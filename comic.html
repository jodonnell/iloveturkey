Once upon a time there were two lesbian turkies named Glazor and
Ultrox (they were part robot).  Unfortunately Ultrox turned out to be
a real crazy bitch and broke Glazor's heart. <br>

Glazor got hammered that night drinking WILD TURKEY.  The next thing
she knew she was being felt up by another beautiful turkey.  Glazor
in an E-KNEE-BREE-ATE-TID state brought the turkey home with her.

The next morning Glazor realized she had been so hammered it was not a
female turkey she had picked up at all!  It was me!  And she chopped
me up and puked on me.
