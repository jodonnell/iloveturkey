(Cut to Sexy Turkey Girlfriend and Mary Kate Olsen entering a swanky NYC apartment)<BR>
<BR>
STG- Hey baby, I'm home, and you'll never guess who I ran into on the street!<BR>
HL- (asleep on bed) What? Oh, who?<BR>
STG- OMG, here she is (points to Mary Kate).<BR>
MKO- Hey Heath.<BR>
HL- Oh, hi Ashl...<BR>
MKO- No...Its me, Mary Kate (looks dissapointed).<BR>
HL- Sorry, I don't have my contacts in.<BR>
STG- Well anyway, Mary Kate, OMG we have so much to catch up on, lets go make some sammies in the kitch (Sexy Turkey Girlfriend walks towards kitchen).<BR>
MKO- Oh Heath one, more thing before I go.<BR>
HL- Yeah, whats that?<BR>
MKO- (with a whisper) Kill yourself...<BR>
<BR>
(End scene, day 1.  The next day, we see Heath walking down the street with his old buddy, Bill Paxton)<BR>
<BR>
BP- And so thats the day I realized, I just can't act.<BR>
HL- Yeah well, it happens.  Hey that reminds me, yesterday the weirdest thing happened.  Mary Kate Olsen stopped by our apartment in the afternoon with Sexy Turkey Girlfriend and...<BR>
BP- Wait, that super hot biatch from Full House?<BR>
HL- No no, thats Ashley, Mary Kate is that ugly skank with the bad breath.<BR>
BP- Right, right.<BR>
HL- Well anyway, as she's leaving my room to go get something to eat, I think I hear her say that I should kill myself!<BR>
BP- Kill yourself? That's the craziest thing I've ever heard!<BR>
HL- I know right, that bitch telling ME, I should kill myself.<BR>
BP- Crazy man, anyway you know I've had that sleeping problem lately? I just got these awesome new pills from the doctor, they just knock me out at night.<BR>
HL- Oh really, I've been having some trouble myself, can I try a few?<BR>
BP- Oh yeah, just take the bottle, I have more at home.<BR>
HL- Really? Thanks mate.<BR>
BP- No prob, but I gotta run, catch you lata playa!<BR>
HL- Thanks again man.<BR>
BP- Oh and one more thing, (with a whisper) Take the whole bottle so you can kill yourself...<BR>
<BR>
(End scene, day 2.  The next night we find Heath at home with his Sexy Turkey Girlfriend.)<BR>
<BR>
HL- God, I have had just the weirdest last couple days.  I mean, can you even believe these people? Supposed to be my friends.<BR>
STG- OMG Heath, you are just so hot, and like those other guys are just like so jealous of us and our awesome relationship.<BR>
HL- Yeah, you're probably right.<BR>
STG- I mean like this one time, my friend Tiff was like OMG your bf is like so hot in that movie with the cowboys.  And I was like, OMG, you are sooo right.<BR>
HL- I know babe, thanks for your support, I'm just a little down in the dumps tonight.<BR>
STG- OMG, you know what will just totally cheer you up?<BR>
HL- No, what?<BR>
STG- One of my world famous cocktails!!!!!<BR>
HL- Oh, ok I guess.<BR>
<BR>
(Sexy Turkey Girlfriend comes back with a big drink in her talons)<BR>
<BR>
HL- Thanks babe.<BR>
STG- It's a special recipe, just for you...<BR>
<BR>
(With his first sip Heath starts to look a little confused and feels woozy.  He falls to the floor with a loud THUMP.  Just before he shuts his eyes for the last time, he looks up and sees someone standing before him.  It is not his Sexy Turkey Girlfriend, not Mary Kate Olsen, or even his old friend Bill Paxton.  Ashley Olsen looks down at him with death in her eyes.<BR>
<BR>
AO- You shouldn't have crossed the Olsen twins Heath Ledger.  And now you pay the price.<BR>
<BR>
(End scene. Curtain.)<BR>
