<h3>I loved my turkey, but I had to kill him</h3>
<br>
I loved my turkey, but i had to kill him.  I first tried to drown him,
but he kept thrashing around so much that i had to let him up.  I then
tried shooting him with a shotgun, but boy was that bastard fast.  I
tried to grab him by the head and snap his neck but he kept pecking at
my hand.  I found some rope and tried to hang the fucker but he bit
clear through the noose!  I finally killed him one day though.  He was
sleeping, and i dressed up like a giant sexy female turkey.  He woke
up and thought he had gone to turkey sex heaven.  He came right up to
me, strutting his stuff, mounted, and began pounding away.  Little did
he kow, I put some explosives up my ass.  KABOOOOOOM!!!!!
