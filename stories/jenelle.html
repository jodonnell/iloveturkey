This is a story by Jenelle.  It fucking sucks.
<br><br>
 it was a few years ago. my dad was driving down the road in his truck
 with the window open (keep in mind we live in east bumfuck) and a
 young turkey flew in the window and hit my dad in the head. it fell
 to the floor and went crazy for a little while until my dad pulled
 over, opened the door and let it out. the end.
