<h3>Who soiled the turkey?</h3><br>

-"This turkey has been fucked," grunted Officer Jim Davies<br>
-"Deputy McDougal, get me my briefcase"<br>
-From his briefcase, Officer Jim Davies withdrew his rubber crime gloves<br>
-He squeezed his latexed hands into the turkey's vagina and withdrew a wallnut
shell<br>
-"Well, whoever fucked this turkey, sure enjoyed his nuts"<br>
-"Officer Jim Davies," shouted Deputy McDougal, "Ive found something else, over
here"<br>
-Officer Jim Davies walked over to Deputy McDougal, looked at the ground, and
almost vomited at the sight<br>
-There was blood, lots of blood<br>
-Lots of blood, and turkeys<br>
-"Deputy McDougal," Officer Jim Davies could barely speak from the stench, "Im
gonna need another box of my rubber crime gloves.  Make that another two boxes"<br>
