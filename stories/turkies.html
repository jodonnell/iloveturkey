<h3>Turkeys</h3><br>

-Turkeys originated in Turkey<br>
-This is why the country Turkey was named Turkey<br>
-It is because Turkey was full of Turkeys<br>
-When they first discovered Turkey, it was a land rich in turkeys<br>
-It was almost a paradise for turkeys, they ruled the land<br>
-There was a King Turkey, who commanded the Royal Turkey Army<br>
-Which had a very good air force as you would imagine (back then turkeys could
fly)<br>
-The turkeys laughed, and sang, and played beach volleyball even<br>
-When the turkeys ruled the land, everyone was happy, especially turkeys<br>
-The turkeys from this area discovered a very important crop we still use
today: corn, or maize<br>
-The turkeys from Turkey also invented the x-ray machine gun<br>
-Today in Turkey, there is not one single turkey, the people kill them on sight<br>
-Why? You might ask<br>
-Because Turkey don't talk turkey (gobble gobble, etc.).<br>
