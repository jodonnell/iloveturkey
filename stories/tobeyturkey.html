<h3>Tobey Turkey</h3>
Tobey Turkey craved cocaine.  Tobey Turkey needed cocaine like my butthole 
needs tampons (my butt needs tampons because of the things i put in there 
LOL).  His eyes on a dreamy diet, were bloodshot.  A ninja landed on the farside 
of the seesaw.  Tobey skyrocketed in a mad game called life.  He landed hard on 
cement shattering his neck in six places.  I fell on Tobey Turkey and breathed 
into his beautiful beak.  My breath lacked the life giving spark Tobey had.  Tobey 
saved my life once and now he was dead.  I ripped into Tobey's breast and 
ripped out his heart.  I began my feast.<br><br>
