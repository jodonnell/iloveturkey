<h3>Saint Edna's Turkey</h3><br>
-Saint Edna had a turkey,<br>
-She named it pinky<br>
-She liked to dress pinky up like a little sailor<br>
-And prance him around the yard like a little gobble puss<br>
-According to Saint Edna, she saved pinky from being killed at the super market<br>
-The thing was, the turkey didn't look like a turkey at all, it was
small, and narrow, and yellow, with a curve<br>
-Its weird, sometimes I hear people mistakenly call turkeys bananas,
and I correct them, isn't that weird?<br>
