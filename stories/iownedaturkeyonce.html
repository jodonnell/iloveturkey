<h3>I owned a Turkey Once</h3>

His name was sugar lips.  I thought that was funny because turkeys don't have 
lips.  They have something so much more sensual.  Sugar lips would gaze at me 
longingly while I cooked.  Sometimes I would look back and our eyes would 
meet, just for a second.  I had sugar lips for three days before he got cancer.  He 
went bald and had a huge tumor on his side.  The attraction was lost and sugar 
lips died alone. <br><br>
