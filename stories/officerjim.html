<h3>Officer Jim Davies solves the case (or does he?)</h3><br>
-"Who would fuck and then kill hundreds of innocent turkeys?" Officer Jim
Davies had been working on the case for weeks now.<br>
-"Deputy McDougal!" shouted officer Jim Davies<br>
-"Yes sir"<br>
-"Im gonna need some more rubber crime gloves, i believe we're on the verge of
cracking this case."<br>
-"But sir," Deputy McDougal gulped, "we're out of rubber crime gloves."<br>
-"Out of rubber crime gloves?!"<br>
-"Y... Yes sir, you used the last pair this morning."<br>
-"Last pair? Morning? Thats it!" Officer Jim Davies sprung from his desk and
ran out of the station.<br>
-"Thats right Officer Jim Davies, you think youve solved the case, but really
youre falling right into my little trap. Hee hee hee."  Deputy McDougal sat
back down at his desk and opened his bottom desk drawer.  In the drawer was an
entire box of rubber crime gloves, and a jar of dried wallnuts.<br>
