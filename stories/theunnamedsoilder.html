<h3>The Unnamed Soilder</h3>
Private Turkey had been in the army for five months.  He had been in battle for 
only two.  Turkey had luckily found some razors on a dead enemy and attached 
them to his own talons.  They glistened in the sunlight so brightly he would 
masturbate to them when Captain Puddy was not looking.  He could shred 
through his enemy so easily with his new talons.  His eyes bulged with lust.  He 
raped the village woman and even their children.  God was watching.  God only 
laughed once and it was when He realized He was a bunch of horseshit.  Private 
Turkey was found dead.<br><br>
