I promised my current turkey 'friend' that I would make a page all devoted to her.  
Well here it is baby =) <br>

I met Mary-Yi (pronounced Mary, the Yi is there so you know she is half chinese, 
I LUV ASIANS!!! LOL) online. For a while I thought she was a man because she 
was very aggresive ;)  I was so happily suprised when I learned she a turkey.  
This was so funny to her because she was worried I would be upset her vagina is 
smaller than my pinky.  What was even funnier is my penis inside her caused her 
to explode.  I miss her =(<br>
