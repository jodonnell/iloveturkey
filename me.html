This part of the page is dedicated to a real ggreat guy, ME LOL. <br>
Ever since I learned that HTML stands for Hyper TEXT Markup Language I
realized I HAD to make a webpage<br>
One Day I was out in the forrest (I'm from Maine) and I saw the most
majestic looking turkey<br>
I was drawn to it in a way I did not understand (for long hehe)<br>
The turkey meandered towards me in SUCH a sexy and determind fashion I
knew what was to happen<br>
The turkey gave me a blowjob for 10 hours!  Thats right 10!<br>
My parents called the police because I was only 14.  The search party
found me while the turkey was still pleasuring me.  <br>
How embarrasing for a 14 year old!<br>
I am very sexually active, I have had 4 female partners and over 20
turkeys!<br>
I have a baby boy.  His name is TRENT.  I named him after the dude
from NIN or Nine Inch Nails.  I love NIN.  I had him with a beautiful
turkey named ZELDA.  Here is a picture of TRENT. <br>
