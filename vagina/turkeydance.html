So recently I have been getting a lot of people ask me, 'JACOB HOW DO
I DO THE TURKEY DANCE.'  And some people even ask me 'JACOB HOW CAN I
HONOR A TURKEY'.  The answer to both is the Turkey Dance!  The turkey
dance can only be one way unless you mean to upset the great turkey
gods.  That is a stupid move.  With the aid of my daring brother we
have recorded the turkey dance (TURKEY GODS DO NOT LIKE CAMERAS ONE
BIT UNLESS THE CAMERA IS AIMED AT THE OLSON TWINS, THE TURKEY GODS
LOVE TO SEE WAT THE TWINS R UP 2.) so that you (the viewer) may watch
it.  Please do not masturbate to this video the Turkey gods would find
that most offensive.<br>
